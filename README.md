# 📱📊 iPhone Top Seller Predictor – ML Web App

**MRP, Sale Price, Discount...**

These are more than just numbers — they can predict whether an iPhone model will be a top seller or not.

👋 Hello! I’m excited to share my latest project: an effective and user-friendly machine learning web app that predicts the success of iPhone models based on:

- MRP Price  
- Sale Price  
- Discount (%)  
- RAM

---

### 🔍 Problem Statement  
Retailers often wonder: *Which iPhone models will perform best in the market?*  
This app provides quick insights using just a few key inputs.

---

### 📊 What Makes It Interactive?

Along with predictions, the app now includes:

- A comparison **bar chart of your inputs vs dataset averages**  
- Separate visual graphs:
  - 📉 *Sale Price vs MRP*  
  - 🧮 *Discount (%) vs RAM*

These help users better **visualize the decision boundaries** and improve model transparency.
